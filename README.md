# recalibrate-spread

A portfolio is defined as a spread. Eg. 50% BTC, 30% ETH, 20% LTC.

This spread is easy to use when first constructing the porffolio, but as the market changes, so does the spread of the portfolio. Eg. BTC may go up 4% while ETH goes up 8%. So to keep the portfolio at a fixed spread, it must be recalirated.

This package calculates the trades necessary to rebalance the spread.
